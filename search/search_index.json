It can include accidental clicks caused by intrusive ad implementations, fraudulent clicking by competing advertisers, advertising botnets and more. Microsoft： 1.流量包括在Bing，AOL和Yahoo拥有并运营或联合的合作伙伴网站上投放的广告展示次数，点击次数和转化次数。 2.点击质量划分：我们将点击分为标准质量，低质量和无效。 2.1标准质量：正常的客户广告点击。 2.2品质低下：具有不明确的商业意图和异常活动模式的点击。这包括无效点击。 2.3无效：具有用户错误，搜索引擎机器人或欺诈行为特征的点击。 原文： 1.Traffic is comprised of ad impressions, clicks and conversions served on Bing, AOL and Yahoo owned and operated or syndicated partner websites. 2.Click quality We categorize clicks as standard quality, low quality and invalid. - 2.1 Standard quality: Normal customer ad clicks. - 2.2 Low quality: Clicks that exhibit characteristics of unclear commercial intent, and patterns of unusual activity. This includes invalid clicks. - 2.3 Invalid: Clicks that exhibit characteristics of user error, search engine robots or fraudulent activity. Microsoft Advertising uses real-time and post-click systems to help guard against low-quality and invalid clicks. Facebook： 1.主要两种形式出现：常规无效流量（GIVT）和复杂的无效流量（SIVT）。两者都使用类似的自动化方法来产生点击，但是GIVT更易于自动化安全系统发现。SIVT积极利用恶意软件，cookie填充，代理流量和其他方法来覆盖其足迹。 原文：Facebook’s most common ad fraud threat is invalid traffic, where a fraudster utilizes bots to generate clicks on an ad. Studies have shown that up to 18 percent of all ad traffic is invalid. It typically comes in one of two forms: general invalid traffic (GIVT) and sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT). Both use similar automated methods to generate clicks, but GIVT is easier for automated security systems to spot. SIVT actively covers its tracks with malware, cookie stuffing, proxy traffic and other methods. 2.无效__ 点击 __主要两种：第一种，不是真正兴趣的点击包括：重复/意外点击，公司内网访问。 第二种，通过被禁止的方式点击，如虚假账户、智能助手、抓取工具、浏览器附加组件，或违反FaceBook条款的其它方式。 Baidu: 1.无效点击是与正常点击相对而言的，指经系统确认的、不会为您带来有效访问的点击，你无需为此支付点击的费用。造成无效点击的方式包括重复性的人工点击，或利用计算机进行的自动点击等 2.无效点击包括以下类别： 2.1以消耗其他客户的推广费用为目的的，由人工或作弊软件产生的点击 2.2其他公司抓取百度网页等产生的机器点击，尽管这类机器点击没有作弊企图，属于无意点击，百度也会将之过滤 2.3人工点击中，由于人为原因或浏览器原因导致的连续多次点击，例如，双击推广结果、浏览器自动多次刷新推广网页产生的点击，系统会自动将第一次以后的点击过滤 MRC、MMA、IAB、TAG: 1.2015年最终版本：IVT分为两类： 1.1通用无效流量（GIVT）：包括通过常规和基于列表的过滤方式，例如漫游器，网络爬虫，其他爬虫；非浏览器用户代理头；以及预提取或浏览器预呈现的流量。 1.2复杂的无效流量（SIVT）：包括通过高级功能识别的流量分析，多点确证，人为干预（例如被劫持）设备，广告代码或广告素材；广告软件；恶意软件；盗用的内容。 原文： Definitions of Invalid Traffic: IVT is separated in two categories: General Invalid Traffic (GIVT): Includes traffic identified through routine and list-based means of filtration—such as bots, spiders, other crawlers; non-browser user agent headers; and pre-fetch or browser pre-rendered traffic. Sophisticated Invalid Traffic (SIVT): Includes traffic identified through advanced analytics, multipoint corroboration, human intervention—such as hijacked devices, ad tags, or creative; adware; malware; misappropriated content. 2.2020年2月5日：最新草案，正在30天的公示期间：（旨在比15年的版本更全面） 2.1 分为：GIVT 和 SIVT, 并增强了GIVT的基准 --- 2.2决策率计算，识别来源和低__检测覆盖情况 2.3扩大流量监测及公开要求 2.4登陆环境的流量过滤/未登陆无账号下的流量过滤 2.5广告主/业务合作伙伴的资格__要求审查 2.6_前置过滤/后置过滤方法指导_ 2.7OTT环境 原文： The new Guidelines draft includes a number of important enhancements to the MRC’s previous IVT guidance, among which are: • The inclusion of updates and clarifications of requirements for General Invalid Traffic (GIVT) and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic (SIVT) detection techniques to reflect the evolved threat landscape, as well as enhancements to baseline GIVT requirements. > - The introduction of a required “Decision Rate” calculation to provide data to users about a service’s IVT detection coverage levels, and to identify sources and inventory with low coverage. The expansion and formalization of traffic sourcing detection and disclosure requirements. The provision of guidance for IVT detection and filtration in “logged-in” environments, and guidance on account invalidation IVT techniques. The enhancement of Business Partner Qualification requirements, including requirements on client access controls and stricter onboarding. The formal incorporation, inclusive of new updates, of previous interim guidance issued through MRC memos on Data Center Traffic, Human Labeling, Sampling, Up-Front Techniques and In-App IVT. The expansion of guidance on Up-Front filtration to include pre- and post-bid approaches. The expansion of In-App guidance to also include Over the Top (OTT) environments. 3.摘自18年国双报告：（IVT详细细分） 中国广告协会: 无效流量的应对 以上各方都是怎么应对无效流量的。方法分类总结，角色总结，流程机制总结 Google: 1.公司角度： 1.1使用一百多种复杂的算法来发现不良流量 1.1.1自动过滤器：使用180多种复杂的过滤器来实时或不久后阻止对大多数无效流量，过滤器会随着时间推移变得更加智能。一组专家不断监视更新每个过滤器，确保最高效率运行 1.1.2实时过滤：先进的过滤器可从一开始就阻止大多数无效流量，比如黑名单/可以点击率/单个用户的点击量过高，会在向广告主收费之前捕获。 1.1.3近实时过滤：某些无效流量通过了过滤器，但看起来有些混乱，将继续监控流量数据，某些情况下，最多可能需要几个星期才能识别可疑模式。 1.1.4手动检测和审查：没有过滤器是完美的，当有case出现，我们将更新和改进过滤器，可以自动阻止具有相同特征的新流量。还会设置警报，以通知该流量出现异常高峰，来进一步了解有关行为的更多信息 1.1.5研究僵尸网络：团队会研究发现非人为流量的老远，寻找可用于查找来自特定来源的所有流量的代码示例。之后，识别来源闭关阻止流量进入系统。 1.1.6暂停和停用账户：有时候，保护广告主和用户的最佳方法是暂停或禁用发布者的账户。 2.广告主角度（公司建议）： 2.1.按照公司的建议作为来防止无效活动： 2.1.1点击量报告细分，以了解访问量和网站访问者、购买流量查看流量提供商清单等 2.1.2优化网站、搜素引擎等 原文： 1.1 Google takes invalid activity very seriously. We use over a hundred complex algorithms to spot bad traffic as it happens, and our global team of PhDs, data scientists, engineers, and researchers works around the clock to prevent advertisers from paying for — and publishers benefitting from — invalid clicks, impressions, views, or interactions. When we find something wrong, we try to make it right as soon as possible. We suspend or disable invalid accounts, and may withhold payments to the publisher. When appropriate and possible, that money is credited back to the advertisers — not only for the month where we found the invalid activity, but often for the previous month, as well. 1.1.1Automated filters. Keeping invalid traffic from impacting you. We use over 180 sophisticated filters to stop the vast majority of invalid traffic in real time or soon after. With a combination of cutting-edge technology and a steady stream of data, our filters actually get smarter over time. A team of specialists continuously monitors and updates each filter to make sure they’re running at peak efficiency. 1.1.2 Filtering in real-time. Stopping invalid traffic before it happens. Our sophisticated filters stop most invalid traffic right from the start. If the activity is associated with a blacklisted user agent or IP address, for example, or if the publisher has a suspiciously high clickthrough rate or traffic from a single user, our filters will catch it before its ever charged to the advertiser. 1.1.3 Filtering in near real-time. Removing confirmed bad traffic. Some invalid traffic takes more time to detect. If something makes it through our filters but still seems fishy, we'll monitor the traffic data until we can be sure. In some cases, it may take up to several weeks to recognize a suspicious pattern. 1.1.4 Manual detection and review. Looking into reported cases of invalid activity. Because no filter is perfect, we also manually review issues flagged by our advertisers, publishers, and automated systems. Whenever we find new threats like botnets or crawlers, we use that information to improve our filters. To make sure we're not filtering any legitimate traffic, we periodically review all our filters and adjust as needed. When our filters identify suspicious traffic but can't be sure it's invalid, our automated systems flag the anomalies and gather data for days to weeks. Then our team of live reviewers can analyze the data and decide what to do. Then look at the way users interact with the ads to figure out if the interactions are interntional or accidental, and separate the non-human traffic from normal activity. Then they look for patterns that could signal invalid traffic from a particular source. When our team identifies invalid behavior, we use the data to update and improve our filters, so we can automatically stop new traffic with the same characteristics. We may also set an alert to be informed of unusual spikes in that traffic, so we can learn more about that behavior. 1.1.5 Research and botnet hunting. Protecting you from new attacks with advanced research. Our Ad Traffic Quality team pores over traffic data to uncover sources of non-human traffic. We search out anomalies in our data, looking for code samples that can be used to find all traffic coming from a particular source. Then, we analyze the code to identify the source and keep its traffic from entering our systems. We also research new kinds of invalid traffic that our filters aren't equipped to detect yet, and investigate small or special cases that might otherwise slip through the cracks. 1.1.6 Suspending and disabling accounts. Stopping invalid activity at the source. Sometimes, the best way to protect advertisers and users is to suspend or disable a publisher's account. If a publisher generates an excessive amount of invalid traffic, we may disable the account immediately. If, on the other hand, a publisher seems to be generating invalid traffic by accident, we may only suspend their account until they fix the problem. Repeat offenders and deliberate abusers may have their accounts disabled and find themselves banned from using our ad platforms. Publishers whose accounts we've disabled have the right to appeal their case. We review every appeal that supplies enough information to investigate, and if we find good cause to reactivate a suspended account, we'll do so right away. Microsoft： 1.公司角度： 1.1 Microsoft Advertising使用实时和单击后置系统来帮助防止低质量和无效点击。 1.1.1点击过滤系统：我们专有的点击过滤系统是一系列复杂的过滤器，可以自动识别不会向广告客户收费的低质量和/或无效点击。 1.1.2定价折扣：在某些市场中，我们的系统会实时评估联合伙伴流量的质量，并可能会调整向广告客户收取的相关点击费用。折扣是根据Microsoft Advertising定价技术可用的数据自动应用的。 1.1.3移除作弊者：如果我们通过主动监控或被动调查发现低质量域名，我们保留删除这些域名的权利。我们还采用了行业标准的IP黑名单方法。 1.1.4广告客户信用：当我们通过自动化系统和被动调查发现无效活动时，我们会向受此活动影响的广告客户发放信用。我们也可能会使用这些发现来更新我们的自动点击过滤系统，以在将来主动检测和过滤类似的活动。 1.1.5检测方法 1.1.6前置主动系统： Microsoft Advertising平台包含一个强大的无效点击过滤系统，该系统部署了各种算法来自动检测和消除无效点击。此外，Microsoft Advertising工程师会主动检查系统警报和数据趋势，以识别可疑活动，解决可能逃避自动过滤系统的点击，并将这些点击记入广告客户帐户。 1.1.7后置反应系统： Microsoft Advertising支持团队与广告商紧密合作，以解答问题或解决其流量质量问题。Microsoft广告流量质量小组审查了广告客户对可疑点击活动的投诉，并在许多内部团队中进行工作以验证数据的准确性和完整性。如果广告客户的投诉确定无效的点击活动逃避了自动过滤系统，则流量质量和支持团队将处理对广告客户帐户的抵免额，并将与内部团队合作确定他们是否可以更新自动化系统，以改善对广告的检测。 2.广告主角度： 2.1遵守Micorsoft Advertising政策 2.2监视关键统计信息：点击次数、点击率、转化率。并考虑点击突增可能因素：季节性变化、新闻事件等 2.3调整广告活动、广告分布、指定位置、IP地址屏蔽等 原文： 1.1Microsoft Advertising uses real-time and post-click systems to help guard against low-quality and invalid clicks. Microsoft Advertising takes user, advertiser and network protection very seriously. Between Microsoft Advertising and the Microsoft ecosystem of security and privacy products, we try to ensure that the Microsoft Search Network provides quality traffic and a safe experience for our customers. Here are some specific methods we use to help protect advertisers: - 1.1.1 Click filtration system: Our proprietary click filtration system is a complex series of filters that automatically work to identify low-quality and/or invalid clicks that will not be billed to advertisers. - 1.1.2 Pricing discounts: In some markets, our systems evaluate in real time the quality of syndicated partner traffic and may adjust the price charged to the advertiser for associated clicks. If this is available in your market, there’s nothing you need to do to take advantage of these pricing discounts. Discounts are applied automatically based on data available to Microsoft Advertising pricing technology. - 1.1.3 Removal of offenders: When we identify low-quality domains as a result of our proactive monitoring or reactive investigations, we reserve the right to remove those domains. We also employ industry standard IP black-listing methodologies. - 1.1.4 Advertiser credits: When we identify invalid activity through our automated systems and reactive investigations, we issue credits to advertisers affected by this activity. We also might use those findings to update our automated click filtration system to proactively detect and filter similar activity in the future. - 1.1.5 Detection methods - 1.1.6 Proactive: The Microsoft Advertising platform contains a robust invalid click filtration system, which deploys various algorithms to automatically detect and neutralize invalid clicks. Additionally, Microsoft Advertising engineers proactively review system alerts and data trends in order to identify suspicious activity, to address clicks that may have escaped the automated filtration systems, and to credit advertiser accounts for those clicks. - 1.1.7 Reactive: Microsoft Advertising support teams work closely with advertisers to answer questions or address issues with their traffic quality. Microsoft Advertising Traffic Quality teams review advertiser complaints around suspicious click activity and work across many internal teams to verify data accuracy and integrity. If an advertiser complaint identifies invalid click activity that escaped the automated filtration system, the Traffic Quality and support teams will process a credit to the advertiser’s account, and will partner with internal teams to determine whether they can update automated systems in order to improve detection in the future. Facebook： 1.公司角度： 1.1自动化检查和验证：广告请求发出后，是否在一定时间发生了；点击是否与特征展示相关，确保以预期的方式匹配等等 1.2广告验证过程的全流程监控：包括广告主账户创建、广告创建、广告付费、实际的广告。以确保没有作弊行为出现 1.3可信赖问责小组：消除欺诈广告流量的跨行业计划：包括亚马逊、迪士尼、谷歌。很多不良行为者中很多针对生态系统参与，需要 TAG 这样的行业机构进行捕获。 原文： 1.1 “We look at things like whether the click has happened within a certain time limit after the ad request was made,” Leathern explained. “We also validate that clicks are associated with specific impressions. It’s really important to make sure those things are matching in expected ways.” 1.2 Most of these checks and validations are done through automated systems, a process that is necessary due to the sheer volume of advertisements Facebook processes each day. Every step of the ad verification process – including advertiser account creation, ad creation, ad payments and the actual ad itself – must be constantly monitored to ensure that fraudsters are not at work. 1.3 Collaboration with advertising platforms is another vital part of Facebook’s ad fraud prevention strategy. The company is part of the leadership council of the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), a cross-industry initiative geared toward eliminating fraudulent ad traffic. Its members include Amazon, Disney and Google. 2.广告主角度： 2.1除了采取措施，另一个关键是透明度：永远的一个挑战是在广告欺诈预防和无缝用户体验之间的平衡。很难准确判定潜在广告商是不是骗子。尽可能提供额外的披露和更多的信息。 原文： Transparency and Moderation are Key One of Facebook’s perpetual security challenges is the need to strike a balance between ad fraud prevention and seamless user experiences – both for advertisers and general users. The social network vets advertisers before granting access, but it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a potential advertiser is a scammer or simply new to the platform. “There are certain kinds of ads where we’re going to require additional disclosure and provide additional information,” he said. “For example, for ads about social issues, elections or politics, we require the advertiser to provide a government identity and we verify their physical address. … [Through the ad library], we provide additional information about who’s being reached, like the demographics, [such as] age, gender and location, so journalists and watchdogs in the public can hold us and advertisers more accountable.” Baidu: 1.公司角度：建立了一套完善的机制，通过数十个维度来监控每次点击，识别无效点击并进行过滤，过滤方式包括： 1.1自动过滤：任何通过百度搜索推广获得的点击，在计费前都须经过我们的过滤系统。过滤系统会根据点击IP、cookie、关键词等参数从多个维度对点击进行分析，一旦发现该点击异常就会标识为无效点击，进而被自动过滤而不计费。 1.2自动调节：系统的分析工具将通过自动分析点击的特征，自动调整线上过滤系统的过滤参数，实现对无效点击的高效拦截。 1.3人机交互：此外，系统还会对点击自动进行排查分析，并将可能存在异常的点击报告给专业的分析人员。若专业人员经分析、处理后确认异常，则将结论反馈给过滤系统，系统根据反馈自动调节过滤参数，实现对无效点击的过滤。 1.4人工分析：除自动分析工具外，百度的专业分析人员还会利用特定技术，开发高级工具对点击进行更深入分析，并针对结论采用相应措施，不断升级、完善过滤系统。 MRC、MMA、IAB、TAG: 1.检测机构角度： 1.1应有足够的空间来检查和删除已知的无效流量（包括非人为流量和非法的人为流量）。建议将无效流量也从下活动中分离出来，考虑到数据归因及逆向工程都是很重要的事情。 2.数据分析： 2.1数据属性和模式分析 2.2统计数据监控和趋势：网站、广告活动等 2.2.1检测机构需要如下数据： 事件类型（描述交易的性质） 交易ID（给定交易的唯一标识符） 时间戳记 IP地址（X转发，MAC地址） 用户代理（完整的用户代理字符串，浏览器和操作系统） Cookie /唯一标识符或移动指纹字段 应用程序标识符（iOS IFA，Google AID，Windows AID） 移动电话号码（出于PI原因可能会被部分遮盖） 推荐人站点信息（如果适用） 设备ID，设备类型 运营商信息；运营商路由 位置信息 发布者ID，网站ID，栏目ID，展示位置ID URL（投放广告的页面或应用的完整URL） 广告商ID，广告系列ID，广告ID，广告类型，广告ID 方法（例如GET，Post） 状态代码（例如200、302、400、500） 预提取标题（X-MOZ / FireFox，X-Purpose/ Safari） OpenRTB属性（如果适用） 视频/音频广告完成数据（即开始，25％，50％，75％，完整） 3.无效流量检测： 3.1前置判断&历史数据分析： 3.1.1来源审查：评估合作伙伴及广告流量来源的合法性 3.1.2数据分析：模式分析、采样方式等、审查相关设备、参数指纹等 3.2流量/活动数据的分析： 3.2.1适用于GIVT一般无效流量： 3.2.1.1检查各项参数（可基于TAG）： User-Agent Header、 黑名单、 流量触发器、 交易速度、 重复交易、 异常检测、 缺失值、缺少UA等、 交易协议验证 事务和浏览器/代理参数不一致等 3.2.1.2可见的伪造的判断 3.2.2适用于SIVT复杂无效流量（不适用于常规无效流量） 3.2.2.1广告软件等：恶意软件；被劫持的设备；被劫持的标签、cookie。 3.2.2.2内部报告要足够详细，以便及时报告错误率等 3.2.2.3前后端检测分析 原文：（参考链接中的 MRC_MMA_IAB_IVT Addendum FINAL (Version 1.0).pdf ，这个不能复制文本，只能截图了） 1. 1. 2.2.1 3. 3.2 国双检测方案： 1.先GIVT：黑名单过滤 -> 再SIVT：复杂过滤 2.多维度组合分析：前后端像素热力图、点击热力图、代码检测、历史数据参考等 3.规则过滤60-70%后，机器学习反制检测改进模型 腾讯灯塔反作弊解决方案： 1.终端识别+云端交叉验证的实时反作弊体系：包括查模型、杀模型、验模型 2.累计10亿终端用户画像、亿级山寨机和黑IMEI库 3.该报告中的黑产分类：引流变现、搬运工薅羊毛、刷量作弊 市场大盘： 市场大盘 Facebook： 1.多达18%的广告流量无效 原文：Facebook’s most common ad fraud threat is invalid traffic, where a fraudster utilizes bots to generate clicks on an ad.

Studies have shown that up to 18 percent of all ad traffic is invalid. It typically comes in one of two forms: general invalid traffic (GIVT) and sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT). Both use similar automated methods to generate clicks, but GIVT is easier for automated security systems to spot.

The expansion and formalization of traffic sourcing detection and disclosure requirements. The provision of guidance for IVT detection and filtration in “logged-in” environments, and guidance on account invalidation IVT techniques. The enhancement of Business Partner Qualification requirements, including requirements on client access controls and stricter onboarding.

We use over a hundred complex algorithms to spot bad traffic as it happens, and our global team of PhDs, data scientists, engineers, and researchers works around the clock to prevent advertisers from paying for — and publishers benefitting from — invalid clicks, impressions, views, or interactions. When we find something wrong, we try to make it right as soon as possible. We suspend or disable invalid accounts, and may withhold payments to the publisher. When appropriate and possible, that money is credited back to the advertisers — not only for the month where we found the invalid activity, but often for the previous month, as well. 1.1.1Automated filters. Keeping invalid traffic from impacting you. We use over 180 sophisticated filters to stop the vast majority of invalid traffic in real time or soon after. With a combination of cutting-edge technology and a steady stream of data, our filters actually get smarter over time. A team of specialists continuously monitors and updates each filter to make sure they’re running at peak efficiency. 1.1.2 Filtering in real-time. Stopping invalid traffic before it happens. Our sophisticated filters stop most invalid traffic right from the start. If the activity is associated with a blacklisted user agent or IP address, for example, or if the publisher has a suspiciously high clickthrough rate or traffic from a single user, our filters will catch it before its ever charged to the advertiser. 1.1.3 Filtering in near real-time. Removing confirmed bad traffic. Some invalid traffic takes more time to detect. If something makes it through our filters but still seems fishy, we'll monitor the traffic data until we can be sure. In some cases, it may take up to several weeks to recognize a suspicious pattern. 1.1.4 Manual detection and review. Looking into reported cases of invalid activity. Because no filter is perfect, we also manually review issues flagged by our advertisers, publishers, and automated systems. Whenever we find new threats like botnets or crawlers, we use that information to improve our filters. To make sure we're not filtering any legitimate traffic, we periodically review all our filters and adjust as needed. When our filters identify suspicious traffic but can't be sure it's invalid, our automated systems flag the anomalies and gather data for days to weeks. Then our team of live reviewers can analyze the data and decide what to do. Then look at the way users interact with the ads to figure out if the interactions are interntional or accidental, and separate the non-human traffic from normal activity. Then they look for patterns that could signal invalid traffic from a particular source. When our team identifies invalid behavior, we use the data to update and improve our filters, so we can automatically stop new traffic with the same characteristics. We may also set an alert to be informed of unusual spikes in that traffic, so we can learn more about that behavior. 1.1.5 Research and botnet hunting. Protecting you from new attacks with advanced research. Our Ad Traffic Quality team pores over traffic data to uncover sources of non-human traffic. We search out anomalies in our data, looking for code samples that can be used to find all traffic coming from a particular source. Then, we analyze the code to identify the source and keep its traffic from entering our systems. We also research new kinds of invalid traffic that our filters aren't equipped to detect yet, and investigate small or special cases that might otherwise slip through the cracks. 1.1.6 Suspending and disabling accounts. Stopping invalid activity at the source. Sometimes, the best way to protect advertisers and users is to suspend or disable a publisher's account. If a publisher generates an excessive amount of invalid traffic, we may disable the account immediately. If, on the other hand, a publisher seems to be generating invalid traffic by accident, we may only suspend their account until they fix the problem. Repeat offenders and deliberate abusers may have their accounts disabled and find themselves banned from using our ad platforms. Publishers whose accounts we've disabled have the right to appeal their case. We review every appeal that supplies enough information to investigate, and if we find good cause to reactivate a suspended account, we'll do so right away.","text_tokens":["还会","uncover","可能","过","细分","系统","learn","disabling","whose","角度","any","模式","进入","（","appeal","最","account","agent","优化","source","老远","suspicious","monitors","with","of","scientists","or","大多","their","review","figure","警报","found","problem","peak","非人","payments","blacklisted","generating","immediately","use","看起","signal","sometimes","over","ve","4","whenever","systems","通知","广告","闭关","they","interntional","’","slip","using","stop","变得","into","researchers","cutting","比如","之后","pattern","收费","keeping","建议","以","no","near","购买","specialists","防止","global","by","re","publisher","are","vast","情况","takes","anomalies","advertiser","at","来","起来","clickthrough","charged","时间","发现","sources","进一步","特定","rate","6","repeat","用户","我们","do","banned","下","访问","platforms","'","账户","作为","accident","time","when","after","需要","until","same","more","代码","信息","ip","了","amount","accounts","behavior","hand","sophisticated","interactions","使用","soon","every","s","reactivate","一","decide","filtering","问者","not","suspiciously","混乱","try","等",",","periodically","原文","就","like","点击率","because","generates","back","滤器",".","withhold","best","审查","views","look","黑名","advertisers","case","报告","kinds","combination","single","发布","month","then","informed","的","filter","2.1","用于","来自","t","so","benefitting","单个","提供商","get","广告主","if","2","a","一组","activity","异常","搜素","it","5","才能","名单","量","about","自动","hunting","1.1","happens","seems","运行","过滤","手动","can","spikes","—","all","other","suspending","impacting","某些","start","clock","makes","1automated","效率","高","黑名单","专家","出现异常","flagged","更新","访问量","完美","new","在","cases","开始","engineers","每个","majority","研究","网站","cause","team","更","-","right","方法","seriously","有关","监控","where","human","attacks","publishers","in","stream","继续","you","accidental","wrong","无效","几个","botnets","could","research","abusers","会","点击","away","used","themselves","what","adjust","well","set","also","高峰","samples","around","检测","多种","weeks","but","网络","公司","credited","advanced","coming","）","needed","查看","offenders","bad","possible","its","some","阻止","impressions","确保","stopping","that","对","reported","暂停","recognize","禁用","issues","equipped","manual","data","has","good","often","该","make","示例","will","supplies","实时","quality","from","and","寻找","后","to","find","为","before","otherwise","special","访问者","several","flag","appropriate","search","流量","识别","disable","code","ever","新","向","investigate","detection","smarter","for","spot","引擎","continuously","是","filters","analyze","unusual","through","清单","live","clicks","enough","不良","perfect","interact","money","prevent","updates","3","智能","sure","suspend","days","fix","多数","automated","算法","associated","按照","但","suspended","团队","捕获","excessive","still","separate","一步","we","复杂","our","botnet","complex","up","way","steady","活动","180","be","监视","先进","行为","查找","high","了解","as","deliberate","most","发布者","相同","出现","将","users","具有","fishy","一百","近","looking","small","最佳","improve","多","google","，","ll","可以","可疑","something","cracks","

low-quality and invalid clicks. Microsoft Advertising takes user, advertiser and network protection very seriously. Between Microsoft Advertising and the Microsoft ecosystem of security and privacy products, we try to ensure that the Microsoft Search Network provides quality traffic and a safe experience for our customers. Here are some specific methods we use to help protect advertisers: - 1.1.1 Click filtration system: Our proprietary click filtration system is a complex series of filters that automatically work to identify low-quality and/or invalid clicks that will not be billed to advertisers. - 1.1.2 Pricing discounts: In some markets, our systems evaluate in real time the quality of syndicated partner traffic and may adjust the price charged to the advertiser for associated clicks. If this is available in your market, there’s nothing you need to do to take advantage of these pricing discounts. Discounts are applied automatically based on data available to Microsoft Advertising pricing technology. - 1.1.3 Removal of offenders: When we identify low-quality domains as a result of our proactive monitoring or reactive investigations, we reserve the right to remove those domains. We also employ industry standard IP black-listing methodologies. - 1.1.4 Advertiser credits: When we identify invalid activity through our automated systems and reactive investigations, we issue credits to advertisers affected by this activity. We also might use those findings to update our automated click filtration system to proactively detect and filter similar activity in the future. - 1.1.5 Detection methods - 1.1.6 Proactive: The Microsoft Advertising platform contains a robust invalid click filtration system, which deploys various algorithms to automatically detect and neutralize invalid clicks. Additionally, Microsoft Advertising engineers proactively review system alerts and data trends in order to identify suspicious activity, to address clicks that may have escaped the automated filtration systems, and to credit advertiser accounts for those clicks. - 1.1.7 Reactive: Microsoft Advertising support teams work closely with advertisers to answer questions or address issues with their traffic quality. Microsoft Advertising Traffic Quality teams review advertiser complaints around suspicious click activity and work across many internal teams to verify data accuracy and integrity. If an advertiser complaint identifies invalid click activity that escaped the automated filtration system, the Traffic Quality and support teams will process a credit to the advertiser’s account, and will partner with internal teams to determine whether they can update automated systems in order to improve detection in the future.","text_tokens":["domains","可能","强大","系统","处理","角度","受此","次数","account","suspicious","across","地址","他们","自动化","help","with","of","or","类似","between","their","accuracy","review","警报","this","use","click","which","4","applied","uses","privacy","systems","广告","they","发放","’","因素","一系列","result","deploys","remove","行业","收费","reactive","ensure","关键","以","those","消除","帮助","屏蔽","nothing","防止","by","是否","micorsoft","删除","are","takes","一个","advertiser","trends","来","事件","contains","charged","发现","2.3","6","系列","我们","do","完整","7","alerts","time","when","available","信息","ip","protection","分布","调整","了","平台","accounts","改善","考虑","单击","市场","methodologies","伙伴","使用","future","monitoring","these","s","许多","credits","credit","收取","not","try","验证","work","投诉","等",",","reserve","原文","点击率","标准","并","低质量","滤器","不会",".","审查","your","黑名","advertisers","确定","的","filter","internal","2.1","neutralize","质量","技术","standard","统计","一系","也","采用","完整性","广告主","if","2","security","low","a","ecosystem","activity","5","network","客户","抵免","名单","新闻","自动","1.1","过滤","can","某些","进行","findings","当","proprietary","黑名单","更新","escaped","teams","工程师","在","engineers","指定","还","-","right","complaints","方法","seriously","监控","突增","变化","verify","evaluate","in","you","无效","investigations","support","会","点击","answer","customers","将来","adjust","also","around","季节性","检测","markets","employ","公司","system","affected","与","offenders","microsoft","转化率","some","that","趋势","对","many","这些","advantage","process","issues","guard","data","billed","provides","该","will","部署","费用","实时","quality","自动识别","应用","动检","and","proactive","定价","自动检测","to","integrity","小组","被动","低质","market","price","similar","search","季节","流量","主动","whether","识别","products","时","向","此外","支持","detection","如果","逃避","解决","for","safe","here","是","合作","filters","through","中","调查","methods","clicks","政策","广告商","robust","2.2","3","removal","based","automated","算法","反应","解答","order","折扣","associated","post","listing","影响","团队","filtration","准确","根据","we","our","复杂","紧密","可用","complex","活动","评估","be","监视","determine","as","包含","将","转化","位置","帐户","improve","platform","额","，","可以","可疑"," ","后置","则","need","series","might","或","数据","作弊者","user","其","technology","遵守","。","issue","相关","域名","questions","invalid","experience","update","an","identify","may","信用","过滤器","black","和","identifies","detect","1","advertising","联合","准确性",":","syndicated","前置","there","address","closely","：","automatically","partner","specific","、","/","专有","additionally","very","作弊","各种","pricing","问题","proactively","移除","检查","on","ip地址","内部","take","industry","行业标准","工作","against","traffic","discounts","real","complaint","通过","the","various","记入","protect","is","权利","保留","工程","have","algorithms"],"title":"Microsoft：","title_tokens":["microsoft","："]},{"location":"%E6%97%A0%E6%95%88%E6%B5%81%E9%87%8F%E7%BB%BC%E8%BF%B0/%E6%97%A0%E6%95%88%E6%B5%81%E9%87%8F%E7%BB%BC%E8%BF%B0/#facebook_1","text":"1.公司角度： 1.1自动化检查和验证：广告请求发出后，是否在一定时间发生了；点击是否与特征展示相关，确保以预期的方式匹配等等 1.2广告验证过程的全流程监控：包括广告主账户创建、广告创建、广告付费、实际的广告。以确保没有作弊行为出现 1.3可信赖问责小组：消除欺诈广告流量的跨行业计划：包括亚马逊、迪士尼、谷歌。很多不良行为者中很多针对生态系统参与，需要 TAG 这样的行业机构进行捕获。 原文： 1.1 “We look at things like whether the click has happened within a certain time limit after the ad request was made,” Leathern explained. “We also validate that clicks are associated with specific impressions. It’s really important to make sure those things are matching in expected ways.” 1.2 Most of these checks and validations are done through automated systems, a process that is necessary due to the sheer volume of advertisements Facebook processes each day. Every step of the ad verification process – including advertiser account creation, ad creation, ad payments and the actual ad itself – must be constantly monitored to ensure that fraudsters are not at work. 1.3 Collaboration with advertising platforms is another vital part of Facebook’s ad fraud prevention strategy. The company is part of the leadership council of the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), a cross-industry initiative geared toward eliminating fraudulent ad traffic. Its members include Amazon, Disney and Google. 2.广告主角度： 2.1除了采取措施，另一个关键是透明度：永远的一个挑战是在广告欺诈预防和无缝用户体验之间的平衡。很难准确判定潜在广告商是不是骗子。尽可能提供额外的披露和更多的信息。 原文： Transparency and Moderation are Key One of Facebook’s perpetual security challenges is the need to strike a balance between ad fraud prevention and seamless user experiences – both for advertisers and general users. The social network vets advertisers before granting access, but it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a potential advertiser is a scammer or simply new to the platform. “There are certain kinds of ads where we’re going to require additional disclosure and provide additional information,” he said. “For example, for ads about social issues, elections or politics, we require the advertiser to provide a government identity and we verify their physical address. … [Through the ad library], we provide additional information about who’s being reached, like the demographics, [such
