This is a good option if your data fits in memory. TensorFlow Dataset objects . This is a high-performance option that is more suitable for datasets that do not fit in memory and that are streamed from disk or from a distributed filesystem. Python generators that yield batches of data (such as custom subclasses of the keras.utils.Sequence class). Keras features a range of utilities to help you turn raw data on disk into a Dataset : tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory turns image files sorted into class-specific folders into a labeled dataset of image tensors. tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory does the same for text files. In addition, the TensorFlow tf.data includes other similar utilities, such as tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset to load structured data from CSV files. Supposed you have image files sorted by class in different folders, like this: main_directory/ ...class_a/ ......a_image_1.jpg ......a_image_2.jpg ...class_b/ ......b_image_1.jpg ......b_image_2.jpg Then you can do: # Create a dataset. dataset = keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory( 'path/to/main_directory', batch_size=64, image_size=(200, 200)) # For demonstration, iterate over the batches yielded by the dataset. for data, labels in dataset: print(data.shape) # (64, 200, 200, 3) print(data.dtype) # float32 print(labels.shape) # (64,) print(labels.dtype) # int32 The label of a sample is the rank of its folder in alphanumeric order. Naturally, this can also be configured explicitly by passing, e.g. class_names=['class_a', 'class_b'] , in which cases label 0 will be class_a and 1 will be class_b . Example: obtaining a labeled dataset from text files on disk Likewise for text: if you have .txt documents sorted by class in different folders, you can do: dataset = keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory( 'path/to/main_directory', batch_size=64) # For demonstration, iterate over the batches yielded by the dataset. for data, labels in dataset: print(data.shape) # (64,) print(data.dtype) # string print(labels.shape) # (64,) print(labels.dtype) # int32 Data preprocessing with Keras Using Keras preprocessing layers In Keras, you do in-model data preprocessing via preprocessing layers . This includes: Vectorizing raw strings of text via the TextVectorization layer Feature normalization via the Normalization layer Image rescaling, cropping, or image data augmentation Example: turning strings into sequences of integer word indices from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization # Example training data, of dtype `string`. training_data = np.array([[\"This is the 1st sample.\"], [\"And here's the 2nd sample.\"]]) # Create a TextVectorization layer instance. It can be configured to either # return integer token indices, or a dense token representation (e.g. multi-hot # or TF-IDF). The text standardization and text splitting algorithms are fully # configurable. vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode=\"int\") # Calling `adapt` on an array or dataset makes the layer generate a vocabulary # index for the data, which can then be reused when seeing new data. vectorizer.adapt(training_data) # After calling adapt, the layer is able to encode any n-gram it has seen before # in the `adapt()` data. Unknown n-grams are encoded via an \"out-of-vocabulary\" # token. integer_data = vectorizer(training_data) print(integer_data) tf.Tensor( [[4 5 2 9 3] [7 6 2 8 3]], shape=(2, 5), dtype=int64) Example: turning strings into sequences of one-hot encoded bigrams from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization # Example training data, of dtype `string`. training_data = np.array([[\"This is the 1st sample.\"], [\"And here's the 2nd sample.\"]]) # Create a TextVectorization layer instance.

You can call it on batches of data, like this: data = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(64, 200, 200, 3)).astype(\"float32\") processed_data = model(data) print(processed_data.shape) (64, 10) You can print a summary of how your data gets transformed at each stage of the model. This is useful for debugging. Note that the output shape displayed for each layer includes the batch size . Here the batch size is None, which indicates our model can process batches of any size. model.summary() Model: \"functional_1\" _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= input_1 (InputLayer) [(None, None, None, 3)] 0 _________________________________________________________________ center_crop_1 (CenterCrop) (None, 150, 150, 3) 0 _________________________________________________________________ rescaling_1 (Rescaling) (None, 150, 150, 3) 0 _________________________________________________________________ conv2d (Conv2D) (None, 148, 148, 32) 896 _________________________________________________________________ max_pooling2d (MaxPooling2D) (None, 49, 49, 32) 0 _________________________________________________________________ conv2d_1 (Conv2D) (None, 47, 47, 32) 9248 _________________________________________________________________ max_pooling2d_1 (MaxPooling2 (None, 15, 15, 32) 0 _________________________________________________________________ conv2d_2 (Conv2D) (None, 13, 13, 32) 9248 _________________________________________________________________ global_average_pooling2d (Gl (None, 32) 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense (Dense) (None, 10) 330 ================================================================= Total params: 19,722 Trainable params: 19,722 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ The Functional API also makes it easy to build models that have multiple inputs (for instance, an image and its metadata) or multiple outputs (for instance, predicting the class of the image and the likelihood that a user will click on it). For a deeper dive into what you can do, see our guide to the Functional API . Training models with fit() Before you can call fit() , you need to specify an optimizer and a loss function (we assume you are already familiar with these concepts). This is the compile() step: model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=1e-3), loss=keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()) Loss and optimizer can be specified via their string identifiers (in this case their default constructor argument values are used): model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy') Once your model is compiled, you can start \"fitting\" the model to the data. Here's what fitting a model looks like with NumPy data: model.fit(numpy_array_of_samples, numpy_array_of_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10) Besides the data, you have to specify two key parameters: the batch_size and the number of epochs (iterations on the data). Here our data will get sliced on batches of 32 samples, and the model will iterate 10 times over the data during training. Here's what fitting a model looks like with a dataset: model.fit(dataset_of_samples_and_labels, epochs=10) Since the data yielded by a dataset is expect to be already batched, you don't need to specify the batch size here. Let's look at it in practice with a toy example model that learns to classify MNIST digits: # Get the data as Numpy arrays (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() # Build a simple model inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28)) x = layers.experimental.preprocessing.Rescaling(1.0 / 255)(inputs) x = layers.Flatten()(x) x = layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")(x) x = layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")(x) outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")(x) model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs) model.summary() # Compile the model model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\") # Train the model for 1 epoch from Numpy data batch_size = 64 print(\"Fit on NumPy data\") history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=1) # Train the model for 1 epoch using a dataset dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size) print(\"Fit on Dataset\") history = model.fit(dataset, epochs=1) Model: \"functional_3\" _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= input_2 (InputLayer) [(None, 28, 28)] 0 _________________________________________________________________ rescaling_2 (Rescaling) (None, 28, 28) 0 _________________________________________________________________ flatten (Flatten) (None, 784) 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense_1 (Dense) (None, 128) 100480 _________________________________________________________________ dense_2 (Dense) (None, 128) 16512 _________________________________________________________________ dense_3 (Dense) (None, 10) 1290 ================================================================= Total params: 118,282 Trainable params: 118,282 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ Fit on NumPy data 938/938 [==============================] - 1s 1ms/step - loss: 0.2671 Fit on Dataset 938/938 [==============================] - 1s 1ms/step - loss: 0.1156 The fit() call returns a \"history\" object which records what happened over the course of training. The history.history dict contains per-epoch timeseries of metrics values (here we have only one metric, the loss, and one epoch, so we only get a single scalar): print(history.history) {'loss': [0.11557048559188843]} For a detailed overview of how to use fit() , see the guide to training & evaluation with the built-in Keras methods . 基金： 参考： https://www.zhihu.com/question/36702693

You can call it on batches of data, like this: data = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(64, 200, 200, 3)).astype(\"float32\") processed_data = model(data) print(processed_data.shape) (64, 10) You can print a summary of how your data gets transformed at each stage of the model. This is useful for debugging. Note that the output shape displayed for each layer includes the batch size .

This is the compile() step: model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=1e-3), loss=keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()) Loss and optimizer can be specified via their string identifiers (in this case their default constructor argument values are used): model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy') Once your model is compiled, you can start \"fitting\" the model to the data. Here's what fitting a model looks like with NumPy data: model.fit(numpy_array_of_samples, numpy_array_of_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10) Besides the data, you have to specify two key parameters: the batch_size and the number of epochs (iterations on the data). Here our data will get sliced on batches of 32 samples, and the model will iterate 10 times over the data during training. Here's what fitting a model looks like with a dataset: model.fit(dataset_of_samples_and_labels, epochs=10) Since the data yielded by a dataset is expect to be already batched, you don't need to specify the batch size here. Let's look at it in practice with a toy example model that learns to classify MNIST digits: # Get the data as Numpy arrays (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data() # Build a simple model inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28)) x = layers.experimental.preprocessing.Rescaling(1.0 / 255)(inputs) x = layers.Flatten()(x) x = layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")(x) x = layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")(x) outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation=\"softmax\")(x) model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs) model.summary() # Compile the model model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\") # Train the model for 1 epoch from Numpy data batch_size = 64 print(\"Fit on NumPy data\") history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=1) # Train the model for 1 epoch using a dataset dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(batch_size) print(\"Fit on Dataset\") history = model.fit(dataset, epochs=1) Model: \"functional_3\" _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= input_2 (InputLayer) [(None, 28, 28)] 0 _________________________________________________________________ rescaling_2 (Rescaling) (None, 28, 28) 0 _________________________________________________________________ flatten (Flatten) (None, 784) 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense_1 (Dense) (None, 128) 100480 _________________________________________________________________ dense_2 (Dense) (None, 128) 16512 _________________________________________________________________ dense_3 (Dense) (None, 10) 1290 ================================================================= Total params: 118,282 Trainable params: 118,282 Non-trainable params: 0 _________________________________________________________________ Fit on NumPy data 938/938 [==============================] - 1s 1ms/step - loss: 0.2671 Fit on Dataset 938/938 [==============================] - 1s 1ms/step - loss: 0.1156 The fit() call returns a \"history\" object which records what happened over the course of training.
